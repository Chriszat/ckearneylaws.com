It\u2019s also one of the most regulated parts of running your business. One wrong step can slow down your approval, or even cause you to lose the license later on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news? With the right approach, you can move through the process faster, avoid costly mistakes, and set yourself up for long-term compliance. This guide breaks down everything you need to know, with tips most people won\u2019t tell you until it\u2019s too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Exactly Is a Liquor License?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><b>liquor license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is your legal permission to sell or serve alcohol. In New York, that permission comes from the State Liquor Authority (SLA). The SLA doesn\u2019t just stamp \u201capproved\u201d on applications, they carefully review your location, your ownership and financing, and how you plan to operate. If something doesn\u2019t meet their standards, they can delay or deny your license.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/types-of-liquor-licenses\/\"><b>The Main License Types (and When Each Fits)<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><b>On-Premises License (OPL):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is for alcohol that will be consumed on the premises, restaurants, bars, hotels, clubs, or theaters. To qualify as a restaurant, you\u2019re expected to serve full entr\u00e9e-style meals and maintain a kitchen or food preparation area. Other venues must still have a suitable food prep space to meet SLA requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Off-Premises License:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is for businesses like liquor stores, wine shops, and certain grocery or drug stores that sell sealed alcohol to be taken off-site. These licenses have their own set of rules, such as restrictions on owning multiple liquor stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Special Event or Catering Permit:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a short-term license for a specific event or for catering companies. In some cases, new businesses can also apply for a <\/span><b>Temporary Retail Operating Permit<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while their main application is under review. This temporary license usually takes about 30 days to process and can be valid for up to 90 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What the SLA Looks for Beyond the Application<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most first-time applicants are surprised by how many factors the SLA considers. They will look at:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your legal right to the space (lease or deed)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear floor plan, photos or diagrams of the premises<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details on how you\u2019ll operate, including hours, food service, music or entertainment, security, and occupancy limits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your location in relation to schools, places of worship, and other liquor-licensed businesses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proof that you have notified the local municipality or community board at least 30 days before applying<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documentation showing where your funding is coming from<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>The 200-Foot Law<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your entrance is on the same street and within 200 feet of a building used <\/span><b>exclusively<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a school or place of worship, the SLA is prohibited from issuing a full on-premises liquor license. This rule has very limited exceptions. However, beer-and-wine-only licenses are not subject to this restriction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your restaurant\u2019s front door faces a church across the street and the distance is 175 feet, you cannot get a full liquor license, but you might still qualify for a beer and wine license.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The 500-Foot Law<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your location is within 500 feet of three or more businesses that already have on-premises liquor licenses, you may have to go through what\u2019s called a \u201c500-foot hearing.\u201d At this hearing, you must show that granting your license is in the public\u2019s best interest. This often involves presenting your operating plan, community support letters, and security measures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019re opening a cocktail bar in a busy nightlife area with several full-liquor venues nearby, expect to face this hearing and come prepared with strong community support.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The 30-Day Advance Notice<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the SLA will review your on-premises application, you must send a written notice to your local municipality or community board at least 30 days in advance. You\u2019ll need proof that this notice was sent, so use a method that provides tracking or delivery confirmation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Speed Options and Smart Timing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re eligible, applying for a temporary retail operating permit can allow you to start serving while your main license is pending. Not all applicants qualify, so it\u2019s best to confirm this early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another time-saver: you don\u2019t need to wait until construction is complete to apply. The SLA will accept detailed floor plans during the build-out phase, just make sure the final build matches exactly what you submitted to avoid delays.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How Old Do You Have to Be to Serve Alcohol in New York?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York, you must be at least 18 years old to serve alcohol or work as a bartender, regardless of whether you\u2019re serving beer, wine, or liquor. Those under 21 can serve alcohol as long as they meet the age requirement and follow all other alcohol service laws. Even though server training programs aren\u2019t legally required, many business owners provide them to reduce liability and demonstrate responsible service practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Quick Location Checklist Before You Commit<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure the distance to nearby schools or places of worship (200-Foot Law)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check how many full-liquor licensees are within 500 feet (500-Foot Law)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your food service setup meets SLA requirements for your license type<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan for your 30-day municipal or community board notice<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather financing and ownership documents ahead of time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See if you qualify for a temporary permit to speed up opening<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><b>liquor license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more than just a form to fill out, it\u2019s about understanding the rules for your location, preparing your application carefully, and setting up your business to operate within the law. Knowing these details before you start can save time, prevent costly surprises, and keep your path to approval moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to Get Approved Fast<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the hospitality world, time is money. Every day your doors stay closed because you\u2019re waiting on a <\/span><b>liquor license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a day of lost sales. The good news? With the right approach, you can speed up the process and avoid common roadblocks that slow down many first-time applicants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/how-to-get-a-liquor-license\/\">step-by-step breakdown of how to move from \u201capplication submitted\u201d to \u201ccheers\u201d<\/a> as quickly as possible, without cutting corners that could cause problems later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Apply Before Your Space Is Finished<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to wait until your build-out or renovation is 100% complete to apply for a liquor license in New York. The State Liquor Authority (SLA) allows you to submit your application using a detailed floor plan instead of final photographs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means you can start the paperwork while your contractor is still installing fixtures or your kitchen is being outfitted. For many businesses, this can shave <\/span><b>weeks or even months<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> off the timeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you wait until the space is ready to submit your application, you could be looking at months of additional delay while the SLA reviews everything. Starting early keeps you on track for your planned opening date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pro tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make sure your submitted floor plan matches exactly what you build. Even small changes, like moving the bar a few feet or adding a stage, can trigger requests for updated plans and push your file to the back of the review queue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A Midtown wine bar owner submitted their application during construction, only to move the restrooms to a different corner after filing. That change required resubmitting plans, adding six more weeks to their timeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Understand the \u201c500-Foot Rule\u201d Early<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest causes of liquor license delays is the <\/span><b>500-Foot Law<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your location is within 500 feet of three or more other businesses with on-premises liquor licenses, the SLA may require a <\/span><b>public hearing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to decide whether granting you a license is in the public\u2019s best interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially common in busy nightlife areas, restaurant districts, or densely packed neighborhoods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A 500-foot hearing doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed, but it does mean your approval could be delayed if you\u2019re not prepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to prepare:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research how many nearby businesses already hold liquor licenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet with your local community board or neighborhood association before the hearing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather letters of support from residents, local businesses, or elected officials.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be ready to show how your business will benefit the community (jobs, safe environment, unique offerings).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A Brooklyn gastropub successfully navigated the 500-foot hearing by presenting a detailed security plan, showcasing their locally sourced menu, and demonstrating strong neighborhood support through signed petitions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Nail the Paperwork the First Time<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest way to slow down your liquor license application? Make a mistake on the paperwork. The SLA is strict about application completeness, and a single missing document can send your file back to the end of the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Common mistakes to avoid:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Missing signatures from all owners or partners<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inconsistent answers between forms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdated or unclear floor plans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forgetting to include pages from your lease or deed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omitting required financial disclosures<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When the SLA has to request corrections, it pauses your review. That pause can last weeks, sometimes months, depending on how quickly you respond and how many other applications are ahead of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pro tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Before submitting, have someone who understands SLA requirements double-check your application packet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Be Ready to Explain Your Financing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA isn\u2019t just concerned with your business concept, they want to know exactly <\/span><b>where your money is coming from<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is to ensure there\u2019s no hidden ownership and that the funds are legitimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Documents you may need:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan agreements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank statements showing available funds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proof of investment from partners<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documentation for personal funds (such as tax returns or sale-of-property records)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your financing isn\u2019t clear or appears incomplete, the SLA will ask for clarification. This can delay your approval until you provide the information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A restaurant in Queens had their approval held up because one investor\u2019s contribution came from an overseas account. It took another two months to get the documentation needed to verify the source of funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying early, knowing the 500-foot rule inside and out, triple-checking your paperwork, and having your financing documentation ready can cut significant time off the approval process. The goal is to hand the SLA a complete, clear, and compliant application on the first try, so it moves forward without stopping for corrections or additional hearings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to get through the process as quickly as possible, working with an attorney experienced in liquor licensing can help you avoid these common delays. They know exactly what the SLA looks for, how to address potential issues before they come up, and how to keep your file moving through the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Old Do You Have to Be to Serve Alcohol in New York?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common questions business owners have when staffing a new bar or restaurant is: <\/span><b>\u201cHow old do you have to be to serve alcohol?\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In New York, the answer depends on the type of alcohol being served and the role of the employee.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Age Requirements You Need to Know<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beer and Wine Service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 Employees must be at least <\/span><b>18 years old<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to serve beer or wine to customers, and they must be supervised by someone <\/span><b>21 or older<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who is responsible for overall compliance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Liquor\/Spirits Service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 The rules are the same as for beer and wine: minimum age is <\/span><b>18<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with supervision from a person <\/span><b>21 or older<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Bartending<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 You must be <\/span><b>18 or older<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to mix and serve drinks in New York.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you allow someone younger than 18 to serve alcohol, you could face fines, penalties, or even <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/liquor-license-suspension\/\">suspension of your liquor license.<\/a> The SLA takes age violations seriously because they directly relate to underage drinking prevention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A restaurant in Manhattan received a costly penalty after a 17-year-old server was caught delivering a beer to a table during a routine SLA inspection. Even though the server was simply carrying drinks to a customer and not making the sale, the violation still counted because they were under the legal age.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Training Isn\u2019t Required, But It\u2019s a Smart Move<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York does <\/span><b>not<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require servers or bartenders to take an alcohol service training course, but providing one is a wise business decision. Programs like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gettips.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS)<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/servsafe.com\/ServSafe-Alcohol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>ServSafe Alcohol<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> teach staff how to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spot fake IDs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize signs of intoxication<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handle customers who are already impaired<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand legal responsibilities when serving alcohol<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Benefit:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not only does training reduce your liability, but it also shows the SLA that you take compliance seriously, something that can work in your favor if you ever face a hearing or inspection.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Staying Compliant After Approval<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting your liquor license is a huge accomplishment, but keeping it in good standing is an ongoing job. It\u2019s much easier to lose your license than it is to get one, and once it\u2019s gone, it can take months, or even years, to get it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to protect your license and avoid unnecessary trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Renew Early<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most New York liquor licenses are valid for <\/span><b>two years<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You should <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/liquor-license-renewal\/\">start your renewal process<\/a> at least <\/span><b>90 days before<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the expiration date. Waiting until the last minute could leave you in a situation where your license lapses, forcing you to stop serving alcohol until it\u2019s renewed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A small wine bar in Queens forgot to file their renewal until the week before expiration. The SLA didn\u2019t process it in time, and they had to operate without alcohol sales for nearly a month, resulting in a major loss of revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Train Your Staff<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you\u2019ve hired experienced servers and bartenders, don\u2019t assume they already know New York\u2019s alcohol laws. Hold regular refresher sessions on:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking IDs every time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing when and how to refuse service<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handling intoxicated or disruptive customers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>3. Follow Your Operating Hours<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liquor license specifies the hours you\u2019re allowed to sell alcohol. Serving outside those approved times is one of the most common, and most avoidable, reasons for suspension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A restaurant in Albany extended its bar service by 30 minutes past the approved cut-off during a busy holiday weekend. When a noise complaint brought in local police, the SLA found the <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/liquor-law-violations-common-mistakes-that-could-cost-you-your-license\/\">violation and issued a suspension.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Report Changes Immediately<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you make significant changes to your business, the SLA needs to know. This includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding or removing business partners<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing your floor plan (like moving the bar or expanding seating)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Switching your business structure (e.g., from an LLC to a corporation)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to report changes can result in penalties or license revocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Avoid \u201cImproper Conduct\u201d Violations<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a broad category that covers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overserving alcohol to visibly intoxicated customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing fights or disorderly conduct on the premises<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning a blind eye to illegal activity (such as drug use or underage drinking)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA holds business owners accountable for what happens inside their establishment, even if you personally weren\u2019t there at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A liquor license is more than just permission to serve alcohol, it\u2019s a responsibility. By following age requirements, training your team, renewing on time, and staying alert to compliance rules, you can protect your business and your license for the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re ever unsure about a rule or situation, it\u2019s always better to double-check with an experienced liquor license attorney than to risk a violation. Staying proactive can save you thousands in fines and keep your doors open without interruption.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Common Mistakes That Get Owners in Trouble<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even well-intentioned businesses can run into problems with the State Liquor Authority (SLA) if they aren\u2019t aware of certain rules. Some of these issues aren\u2019t obvious, which is why they catch owners off guard. Knowing what to watch out for can save you time, money, and stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Not Addressing Past Violations on the Property<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your location had a previous owner who broke SLA rules, such as serving alcohol to minors or operating outside approved hours, those violations can still haunt your application. The SLA may worry the same problems will happen again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid it:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research the location\u2019s history before signing a lease.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If violations exist, prepare a written plan showing exactly how you\u2019ll prevent similar issues, like adding ID scanners or training staff more frequently.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A bar location in Brooklyn had three underage service violations under the old owner. The new owners were approved only after presenting a detailed plan for stricter ID checks and hiring a security manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Assuming Local Approval Means SLA Approval<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because your community board or local officials say yes doesn\u2019t mean the SLA will follow suit. The SLA considers more than just local sentiment, they look at your operating plan, location restrictions, and compliance history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Treat local approval as one step in the process, not the final hurdle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Not Keeping Proper Records<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA can request to see your sales records, staffing logs, or security footage at any time. If your records are messy or incomplete, it can look like you\u2019re trying to hide something, even if you\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Best practice:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep all invoices, payroll records, and receipts organized and accessible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Store them for at least the minimum time required by law (usually a few years).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A restaurant avoided fines during an SLA inspection because they were able to immediately produce detailed sales records showing compliance with alcohol service laws.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Ignoring Social Media Evidence<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today\u2019s digital world, what happens in your business doesn\u2019t always stay there. Photos and videos posted online can be used by the SLA as evidence of violations, like customers drinking after hours, bartenders serving minors, or unsafe crowd conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to protect yourself:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train staff to recognize and stop prohibited behavior before it becomes a problem.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor your business\u2019s tagged photos and videos so you can address any issues quickly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Bonus Pitfalls to Avoid<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Running \u201call-you-can-drink\u201d specials<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 These can be seen as promoting excessive drinking and may draw SLA attention.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Failing to update your license after changes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 Moving the bar, expanding the seating area, or changing ownership without notifying the SLA can result in penalties.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overlooking training for part-time or seasonal staff<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 Even temporary employees need to understand the rules.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Why Hiring a Liquor License Attorney Helps You Move Faster<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The liquor license process can be technical, and even a small oversight can delay your approval by months. An attorney who specializes in New York liquor licensing can guide you through every step and help you avoid these pitfalls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What the right attorney can do:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your application is complete and accurate the first time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare you for community board and SLA hearings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respond to SLA information requests quickly and effectively<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advise you on compliance strategies so you can avoid costly violations in the future<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kearney Law Group, led by former judge and state prosecutor Cannon C.
