Whether you&#8217;re in Buffalo or Brooklyn, understanding New York liquor laws is the first step to keeping your business legal and your license safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, we\u2019ll break down what these laws cover, how NYC liquor laws add a few more hoops, and what you absolutely need to know before pouring that first drink.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Are New York Liquor Laws?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York liquor laws are the rules set by the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA). The SLA regulates the manufacturing, distribution, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages throughout the state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These laws cover:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who can sell or serve alcohol<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of alcohol can be sold<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When alcohol can be served<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where alcohol can be consumed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How alcohol must be stored and labeled<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Penalties for breaking the rules<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s walk through the most important ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Key Alcohol Laws in New York State<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own or plan to open a business that sells or serves alcohol in New York, knowing the laws is more than just good practice, it\u2019s essential. New York has some of the most detailed alcohol regulations in the country, and the penalties for violations can be severe. Below, we\u2019ve broken down the most important parts of the law, using plain language and citing the actual statutes from the <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nysenate.gov\/legislation\/laws\/ABC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>New York Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Law<\/b><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so you can see where each rule comes from.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Legal Drinking Age: 21 Years Old<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>ABC Law \u00a7 65(1) &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0In New York, it is illegal to sell or give alcoholic beverages to anyone under the age of 21. This applies regardless of whether the person presents a fake ID or is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a licensee or employee serving alcohol, you are responsible for confirming the legal age of every customer. This is usually done by checking a valid form of government-issued photo identification. Accepted forms of ID include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A driver\u2019s license or non-driver ID issued by a U.S. state<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A valid U.S. passport or passport card<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A military ID<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A valid foreign passport with a U.S. visa<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if a customer appears to be over 21, it is your duty to check their ID if there is any doubt. Failure to verify age can result in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil fines<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Criminal charges<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suspension or revocation of your liquor license<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are <\/span><b>no exceptions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under the law, even if the minor is consuming alcohol in a private setting or under parental supervision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Permitted Hours of Sale<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>ABC Law \u00a7 105(14), \u00a7 106(5) &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol cannot be sold or served around the clock in New York. The ABC Law limits the hours of sale, and those limits vary depending on the type of license you hold and the county where your business is located.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are general statewide rules, though counties may adopt stricter schedules:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>On-premises sales (bars, restaurants):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 8:00 AM to 4:00 AM<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Off-premises sales (liquor and wine stores):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 9:00 AM to midnight, Monday through Saturday<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sunday sales:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Allowed from 12:00 PM to 9:00 PM for liquor and wine; beer may be sold earlier in grocery stores and delis, often beginning at 8:00 AM<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate in New York City, you may be allowed to serve until 4:00 AM, but the actual hours you are permitted to operate will be written into your license approval from the SLA. You must strictly follow these approved hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating the permitted hours of sale is a direct breach of the ABC Law and can lead to significant penalties, including license suspension or revocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Types of Liquor Licenses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>ABC Law \u00a7\u00a7 63, 64, 64-a, 64-b, 97-a, 98 &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no single liquor license that fits all business models. New York State offers multiple categories of licenses based on what type of alcohol is being sold, whether consumption happens on or off the premises, and whether the business is permanent or temporary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few of the most common:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>On-Premises Liquor License (ABC \u00a7 64):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Allows the sale of beer, wine, and spirits for consumption on-site (restaurants, bars, lounges).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Off-Premises License (ABC \u00a7 63):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Allows the sale of alcohol in sealed containers for consumption off-site (liquor and wine stores).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beer &amp; Wine License (ABC \u00a7 64-b):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Permits beer and wine sales for on-site consumption but not hard liquor.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Temporary Retail Permit (ABC \u00a7 97-a):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For businesses waiting for their full license to be processed, usually valid for up to 90 days.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Catering Permit (ABC \u00a7 98):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For off-site events like weddings, fundraisers, or corporate functions.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each license has strict rules regarding what beverages can be sold, during what hours, and in what setting. Selling alcohol outside of your license type is a violation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. The 200-Foot Rule<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>ABC Law \u00a7 64(7) &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> New York prohibits full liquor licenses for establishments located within <\/span><b>200 feet of a school or place of worship<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is a strict rule with no exceptions. The measurement is taken in a straight line from the entrance of the establishment to the entrance of the school or church, regardless of actual walking distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This law applies to all new applications for full on-premises liquor licenses. Beer and wine licenses, however, are not subject to this restriction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your proposed business location is within 200 feet of a school or religious institution, you may be ineligible for a full liquor license. A beer and wine license may still be an option, depending on the zoning and the community\u2019s position.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. The 500-Foot Rule<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>ABC Law \u00a7 64(6-a) &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your business is applying for a new full on-premises liquor license and there are <\/span><b>three or more<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> existing licensed establishments within <\/span><b>500 feet<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will likely be subject to a <\/span><b>500-Foot Hearing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the SLA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of this hearing is to determine whether approving another license in that area is <\/span><b>in the public interest<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To be successful, applicants must often provide:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A plan for noise control and crowd management<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Letters of support from neighbors or community organizations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidence of responsible ownership and clean business history<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This rule is most commonly triggered in New York City and other dense areas with high concentrations of restaurants and bars.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The SLA<\/a><\/span><\/strong> evaluates whether the area is becoming oversaturated and whether a new business might negatively affect quality of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approval is not guaranteed. Strong community opposition can lead to denials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Community Board Reviews in NYC<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Not written into ABC Law, but required by SLA Rule and NYC Procedure &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York City, applicants for new on-premises licenses must give at least 30 days\u2019 advance written notice to the Community Board for the neighborhood where their business is located. This requirement stems from SLA rules and city protocol, not state legislation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Community Board may hold a public meeting where applicants present their plans and answer questions about the business. These boards consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating hours<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noise levels<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor seating plans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impact on parking and pedestrian traffic<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Community Boards do not have the power to approve or deny licenses directly, their recommendation is submitted to the SLA and can significantly influence the outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses work with legal counsel to prepare for these meetings and respond to community concerns in a professional, cooperative way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. Alcohol Awareness Training<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Recommended by the SLA but not mandated under ABC Law &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> New York does not require server training programs by law, but the State Liquor Authority highly encourages licensees to have employees complete alcohol awareness programs like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>TIPS (Training for Intervention Procedures)<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>ATAP (Alcohol Training Awareness Program)<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These programs teach staff to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check and verify IDs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize signs of intoxication<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">De-escalate tense situations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand legal liabilities for overserving<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Completing these programs may be considered a mitigating factor during SLA violation hearings and can help reduce penalties if a mistake is made. Some insurance providers even offer discounts to businesses with certified staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses in high-risk environments (bars, nightclubs, late-night venues), this training is especially valuable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12535 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"New York Liquor Laws Explained: What You Must Know Before Serving Alcohol\" width=\"650\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1-1120x560.jpg 1120w, https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/New-York-Liquor-Law-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Staying Compliant After You\u2019re Licensed<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting your liquor license approved is a big step, but it\u2019s only the beginning. Once you start selling or serving alcohol, you must follow New York liquor laws every single day. The State Liquor Authority (SLA) holds license holders to a high standard, and even one mistake can lead to serious consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you stay on the right track? Let\u2019s break down what compliance really looks like after your license is issued.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Always Check IDs, and Know What to Look For<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common violations is selling alcohol to someone under 21. This can happen quickly, especially in a busy setting, but the law doesn\u2019t make exceptions. It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure everyone who buys or is served alcohol is legally old enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What you need to do:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train all employees to ask for ID from anyone who appears under 30.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure they know how to spot fake IDs, check the expiration date, photo, and security features.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep a list of acceptable forms of ID (driver\u2019s license, state ID, U.S. passport, military ID).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can use ID scanners for extra verification, but they don\u2019t replace good judgment. Staff should always look closely at the ID, not just swipe it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Stick to Your Licensed Hours<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liquor license includes specific hours when you\u2019re allowed to sell or serve alcohol. These hours may vary depending on your license type, location, and the decisions made during your application process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Selling alcohol before or after your approved hours is a violation, even if state law allows longer hours in your area. What matters most is what\u2019s written on your actual license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Example:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In NYC, state law may allow alcohol service until 4:00 AM, but if your license only allows service until 2:00 AM, serving after that time could trigger enforcement action.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Keep Accurate Records<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York liquor laws require businesses to keep detailed records related to alcohol sales and inventory. This includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase invoices from distributors<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily or weekly sales reports<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory logs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incident reports (such as when someone is refused service or becomes intoxicated)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why it matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you\u2019re ever investigated or audited by the SLA, they may ask for these records. Missing or incomplete documentation can lead to fines, or make it harder to defend yourself in case of a violation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How long should you keep records?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Keep all alcohol-related records for at least <\/span><b>three years<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per SLA guidance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Post the Required Notices<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are legally required to display certain documents and warnings in your establishment. These must be clearly visible to both customers and inspectors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Required postings include:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your current liquor license<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pregnancy warning signage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signage stating you will not sell alcohol to anyone under 21<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any conditional restrictions or stipulations specific to your license<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Where should you post them?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Near the bar or service counter, in a common area, or wherever alcohol is served. Don\u2019t hide these documents behind the register or in a back office.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Maintain a Safe and Orderly Business<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business must be kept clean, safe, and under control, especially when alcohol is involved. Disorderly premises are a common cause of violations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to watch for:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overcrowding or blocked exits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loud music or noise complaints from neighbors<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical altercations or fights<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers leaving visibly intoxicated<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsanitary conditions (especially in restrooms and kitchens)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always have enough staff to monitor guests, especially during peak hours. Hire security or crowd control if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Did You Know?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Under <\/span><b>ABC Law \u00a7 106(6)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your license can be suspended if your premises become a \u201cdisorderly house\u201d, meaning a place where the law is regularly violated or where dangerous conditions exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Happens If You Break the Rules?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mistakes happen, even when you\u2019re trying to do everything right. Maybe a staff member forgets to check an ID. Maybe you stay open past your approved hours during a busy night. These might seem small in the moment, but in the eyes of the <\/span><b>New York State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>you are fully responsible for everything that happens under your liquor license.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that includes your employees&#8217; actions, the behavior of your patrons, and the overall safety of your business. So what happens if you, or someone on your team, breaks the rules?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a closer look at the real consequences of violating New York liquor laws, along with answers to questions many business owners ask when they&#8217;re facing trouble with the SLA.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Fines<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>What it is:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A monetary penalty the SLA may issue if your business commits a violation. This is one of the most common enforcement actions, and usually what happens for first-time or less serious mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How much is the fine?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fines can range from a few hundred dollars to over $10,000, depending on the type and severity of the violation. Examples include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to check ID<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling alcohol during unauthorized hours<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improper signage or recordkeeping<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serving visibly intoxicated patrons<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Can I negotiate the fine?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In some cases, yes. If you respond promptly and show that you\u2019ve corrected the issue, the SLA may consider lowering the fine or settling informally. But ignoring the notice or arguing without evidence usually makes things worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Temporary Suspension<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>What it is:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A temporary stop to your ability to sell or serve alcohol. If your license is suspended, <\/span><b>you must immediately stop all alcohol-related activity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including removing promotional signs, storing open containers, or letting customers bring in their own drinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>When does this happen?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Suspensions are often issued for more serious or repeated violations, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling to a minor<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing fights or illegal drug activity on the premises<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over-serving visibly intoxicated patrons<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to follow previously imposed conditions (like restricted hours)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>How long does the suspension last?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It depends. Some suspensions are for a specific period, like 10, 30, or 60 days. In urgent cases, the SLA can issue an <\/span><b>emergency suspension<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (known as a &#8220;summary suspension&#8221;) immediately, without a hearing, if they believe there\u2019s an immediate threat to public safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Permanent Revocation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>What it is:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Losing your liquor license permanently. Once a license is revoked, <\/span><b>you must shut down all alcohol sales immediately, and you may not be allowed to reapply again<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without permission from the SLA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What leads to revocation?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This happens when there\u2019s:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A long history of serious violations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidence of criminal activity tied to your business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to cooperate with SLA investigations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating without a license or outside your license terms<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revocation is the <\/span><b>most serious penalty<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the SLA can impose, and it effectively shuts down your ability to operate in the alcohol industry. In many cases, revocation is also made public and can affect your ability to get licensed in the future, even under a new business name.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Denied Renewal<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>What it is:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even if your business has been open for years, the SLA can <\/span><b>refuse to renew your license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when it expires if you\u2019ve developed a poor compliance record.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>When does this happen?<\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This usually happens if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve had multiple violations in the last license term<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You failed to meet the conditions of a previous settlement<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community complaints or police reports suggest your business is unsafe or disruptive<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You submitted an incomplete or misleading renewal application<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Can I appeal a denial?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes, but time is limited. You&#8217;ll need to respond quickly and often appear at a hearing.
