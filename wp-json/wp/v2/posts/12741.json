That\u2019s where <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renewing your liquor license on time helps you avoid penalties, protect your business, and keep serving customers without interruptions. In this guide, we\u2019ll explain how to renew your liquor license in New York, how long each license type lasts, and what mistakes to avoid so you can stay compliant and keep your business running smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Renewing Your Liquor License Matters<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own a bar, restaurant, liquor store, or any other business that sells alcohol, keeping your liquor license active isn\u2019t just something that\u2019s \u201cnice to do\u201d, it\u2019s the law. Letting it expire, even for just a few days, can lead to serious consequences that can affect your business, your income, and even your ability to get a new license later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why is <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so important?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s break it down:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. You Could Face Expensive Fines<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) doesn\u2019t take expired licenses lightly. If you continue to sell alcohol after your license expires, even by mistake, you can be hit with heavy fines. These penalties can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Your Business Could Be Shut Down<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling alcohol without a valid license is illegal in New York. If you\u2019re caught operating without one, <a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the SLA<\/a> can suspend your business operations or even revoke your license. That means no sales, no customers, and no income until the issue is resolved.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. It Could Damage Your Reputation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a licensed business means you\u2019re trusted to follow the rules. If word gets out that your license expired or you\u2019re under investigation, customers and business partners may lose confidence in your business. Once your reputation is damaged, it can be hard to win people back, even if you fix the problem quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. You Might Not Be Able to Get a New License<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, if your license lapses and you continue to operate illegally, you could lose your right to reapply. The SLA keeps track of violations, and past mistakes can hurt your chances of getting approved in the future. Renewing on time helps you avoid getting flagged for issues that can follow your business long-term.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u201cDo I Really Need to Renew It If Nothing\u2019s Changed?\u201d<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you absolutely still need to renew your liquor license, even if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business hasn&#8217;t moved<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your ownership hasn\u2019t changed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your sales are steady<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You haven\u2019t had any problems<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renewal isn\u2019t just about checking a box. It\u2019s about showing the state that you\u2019re still in compliance with all current laws and that your business is still operating responsibly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u201cCan\u2019t I Just Renew It After It Expires?\u201d<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> apply again, but you may not be allowed to simply renew. If your license has already expired, you might be required to go through the full application process again. That takes more time, more money, and often more paperwork. During that gap, you won\u2019t be able to legally sell alcohol, and that could cost you big.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why You Should Renew Early<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good idea to start the <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process at least 60 to 90 days before your license expires. This gives you plenty of time to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather paperwork<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fix any issues<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submit your application<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get help from a lawyer if needed<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting until the last minute increases the chances of making mistakes or running into delays, and that could mean missing the deadline entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liquor license is one of the most important parts of your business. It allows you to legally serve customers, grow your reputation, and avoid legal trouble. Failing to renew it on time, even accidentally, can lead to big problems that are often more expensive and stressful than simply renewing it on time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Long Does a Liquor License Last?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wondering <\/span><b>how long does a liquor license last<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the answer depends on the type of license you have and what kind of alcohol-related business you run. In New York, not all liquor licenses follow the same timeline, so it\u2019s important to know what applies to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a closer look:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12742 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/liquor-license-renewal-300x300.png\" alt=\"liquor license renewal timeline\" width=\"354\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/liquor-license-renewal-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/liquor-license-renewal-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/liquor-license-renewal.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Retail Liquor Licenses \u2013 Usually 2 Years<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own a <\/span><b>bar<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>restaurant<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>hotel<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><b>liquor store<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you probably hold a retail license. These are the <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/types-of-liquor-licenses\/\">most common types of licenses issued<\/a> by the <\/span><b>New York State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In most cases, they\u2019re valid for <\/span><b>two years<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the date they\u2019re issued.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Wholesale and Manufacturing Licenses \u2013 Usually 3 Years<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses that manufacture or distribute alcohol, like breweries, distilleries, wineries, and distributors, typically receive <\/span><b>wholesale or manufacturing licenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are valid for <\/span><b>three years<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These licenses come with their own set of rules and responsibilities, so it\u2019s essential to stay on top of expiration dates.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Temporary Liquor Permits \u2013 Around 90 Days<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re just getting started or waiting for full license approval, you may be operating under a <\/span><b>temporary permit<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are usually valid for about <\/span><b>90 days<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are often granted while your long-term license application is still being reviewed. Keep in mind that once your full license is issued, the temporary one becomes void.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How Can You Check Your License Expiration Date?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not sure when your liquor license expires, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s easy to check. You can:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the original paperwork you received from the <\/span><b>SLA<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit the SLA License Lookup Tool and search by your business name or license number<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call the SLA directly if you need extra help<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This information is public and accessible, so there\u2019s no excuse for being caught off guard by an upcoming expiration.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why It\u2019s Important to Know Your Expiration Date<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing <\/span><b>how long your liquor license lasts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> helps you plan ahead. If you let it expire by accident, you could face fines, lose your ability to sell alcohol, or even have to go through the full application process all over again, which takes time and money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even worse, if you&#8217;re caught selling alcohol with an expired license, the penalties could damage your business reputation or cause permanent loss of your license.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Should You Start the Renewal Process?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the smartest things you can do is set a reminder for yourself, at least <\/span><b>90 days before your license expires<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That gives you enough time to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather the required paperwork<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Update any business details<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submit your renewal application<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fix any issues that come up along the way<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><b>The Kearney Law Group<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we recommend starting early so you don\u2019t feel rushed or risk missing your deadline. Many of our clients set calendar reminders 3 to 4 months ahead of time, just to be safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Happens If You Let It Expire?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the thing: once your license expires, you\u2019re no longer legally allowed to sell alcohol, period. You\u2019ll need to stop all alcohol sales immediately. On top of that, the <\/span><b>SLA<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may require you to submit a brand-new application instead of just renewing. That process is longer, more expensive, and could seriously interrupt your business operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, <\/span><b>how long does a liquor license last<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New York?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Retail licenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: about <\/span><b>2 years<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wholesale\/manufacturing licenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: around <\/span><b>3 years<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Temporary permits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: usually <\/span><b>90 days<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter which type you have, always check your expiration date and plan ahead.

Whether this is your first time handling <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or you\u2019ve done it before, following these steps can help you avoid delays, extra fees, or worse, an expired license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a complete guide to renewing your liquor license the right way:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Step 1: Look Up Your License Details<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you begin the renewal process, take a few minutes to review your current license information. You\u2019ll want to confirm:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><b>license number<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><b>license type<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><b>expiration date<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>name and address<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> listed on the license<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can find this information on the paperwork you received from the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) or by using their <a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/public-query\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">License Lookup Tool.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If anything has changed, like your business name, address, or ownership, you\u2019ll need to update that during the renewal process. Making sure everything matches now can prevent issues later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Step 2: Watch for Your SLA Renewal Notice<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>About 90 days before your license expires, the SLA usually mails out a renewal notice to the address they have on file. This packet includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">The renewal application<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/how-to-get-a-liquor-license\/\">Instructions on how to complete it<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A reminder of your <\/span><b>deadline<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here\u2019s the thing: if you don\u2019t receive the notice, you\u2019re still responsible for renewing. Lost mail or outdated records won\u2019t excuse a missed deadline. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to <\/span><b>set your own calendar reminders<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and check the SLA website if you&#8217;re getting close to your expiration date.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Step 3: Complete the Renewal Application<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now it\u2019s time to fill out the renewal application. It\u2019s not just a simple form, you\u2019ll likely need to provide updated documentation about your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be ready to include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basic <\/span><b>business information<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Owner or corporate structure updates<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (if anything changed)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Current lease or deed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your location<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any required <\/span><b>community board notices<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (especially if you\u2019re in NYC)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated <\/span><b>floor plans or photos<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (if requested by the SLA)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Contact information<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including a valid email and phone number<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Helpful tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Take your time and double-check every section. Even small mistakes, like a missing signature or outdated address, can cause delays and put your liquor license renewal at risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Step 4: Pay the Renewal Fee<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your application is complete, it\u2019s time to submit the renewal fee. The amount you owe depends on the type of license and where your business is located. Here\u2019s what to expect:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Retail businesses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like restaurants or bars) usually pay <\/span><b>a few hundred to a few thousand dollars<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wholesale or manufacturing licenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be <\/span><b>higher<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depending on the scope of the business<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment is typically made by <\/span><b>check or money order<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, payable to the New York State Liquor Authority. Always check the most up-to-date instructions on the SLA website before sending your payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Step 5: Submit Your Renewal Early<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA recommends submitting your renewal application at least <\/span><b>30 days before your license expires<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but we suggest giving yourself even more time, <\/span><b>60 to 90 days<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why? Because if anything is missing or incorrect, you\u2019ll need time to fix it before your license runs out. Submitting early helps you avoid:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delays in processing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">License lapses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SLA penalties<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Temporary shutdowns<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Remember:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can\u2019t sell alcohol without an active license, even for one day. Starting early is the best way to protect your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What If You Miss the Deadline?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes things slip through the cracks. But with liquor licenses, even a small delay can turn into a big problem. Here\u2019s what can happen if you let your license expire:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>1. You Must Stop Selling Alcohol Immediately<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling alcohol without a valid license is illegal. If your license has expired, you must stop alcohol sales right away, even if you\u2019ve already applied late.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>2. You May Need to Apply for a Brand-New License<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, you can\u2019t simply renew once your license has lapsed. You may have to start over with a new application, which takes more time, money, and paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>3. You Could Face Fines or Legal Action<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA can issue fines or penalties if you\u2019re caught operating without a valid license. These fines can be steep and could even hurt your chances of being approved in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>4. You Risk Losing Customers and Income<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a temporary shutdown can damage your reputation and hurt your bottom line. Customers may not come back, and you may lose valuable business days while waiting for approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why It\u2019s Not Worth the Risk<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We get it, business owners are busy. But <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn\u2019t something to put off. Renewing on time protects your ability to operate legally, keeps your customers happy, and gives you peace of mind knowing your business is in good standing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Common Mistakes to Avoid During Liquor License Renewal<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even experienced business owners can run into trouble during the <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process. At <\/span><b>The Kearney Law Group<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019ve helped many New York bar and restaurant owners fix issues that could have been avoided with a little extra attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most common mistakes we see, and how to avoid them:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>1. Waiting Until the Last Minute<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most frequent mistake. Renewal might seem simple, but it can take longer than expected, especially if the SLA requests more documents or information. If you wait too long, you could miss your deadline and risk letting your license expire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do instead:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Start preparing at least <\/span><b>60\u201390 days before your expiration date<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This gives you plenty of time to gather documents, fix any issues, and submit everything well before the deadline.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>2. Forgetting Important Documents<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA requires specific paperwork with your renewal, including business details, lease agreements, and any changes in ownership or location. Leaving out just one item can delay your approval or cause your application to be rejected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do instead:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use a checklist and double-check your application before submitting it. If you&#8217;re not sure what to include, it\u2019s best to ask a professional (or contact our team, we\u2019ll help you get it right the first time).<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>3. Not Notifying the Community Board (If Required)<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In parts of New York City, certain licenses require you to notify the local community board about your renewal, especially if you\u2019ve had any violations, changes in hours, or noise complaints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Skipping this step can hold up your application or even result in a denial if local officials raise concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do instead:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Check whether your license requires community board notification and make sure to follow the proper steps. We can guide you through this process to make sure nothing is missed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>4. Assuming Nothing Has Changed<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some owners think, \u201cI haven\u2019t changed anything, so I can just submit the same info again.\u201d But small changes, like a new partner, an updated lease, or even a minor floor plan adjustment, need to be reported to the SLA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Failing to report changes can be seen as misrepresentation and might cause delays or penalties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do instead:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Review your business details closely. If anything at all has changed, include it in your renewal or speak with a lawyer to ensure you&#8217;re following the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Can a Lawyer Help with Liquor License Renewal?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely, and in many cases, getting help from an experienced Asset Recovery Attorney can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><b>The Kearney Law Group<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019ve helped business owners across New York navigate the renewal process smoothly and confidently. Whether your case is simple or more complicated, we can help with:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Making Sure Your Paperwork Is Complete and Accurate<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We review all <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/liquor-license-requirements\/\">required documents<\/a><\/strong> to make sure nothing\u2019s missing or filled out incorrectly. This helps avoid delays or rejections.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Staying in Compliance with SLA Rules<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA\u2019s rules can change, and what worked last year might not be enough this year. We keep up with current laws so you don\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Filing on Time and Avoiding Penalties<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We track your license expiration and help you file your <\/span><b>liquor license renewal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> application before the deadline, giving you peace of mind and a clear timeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Handling Business Changes Like Ownership or Location<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business has new owners, moved locations, or changed its hours or setup, your renewal gets more complex. We handle those changes so you stay in compliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Communicating with the SLA on Your Behalf<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If questions or issues come up, we communicate directly with the SLA for you. You don\u2019t have to worry about navigating the process on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What If You\u2019ve Moved or Changed Owners?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If your business has moved to a new location or you\u2019ve had a change in ownership, your liquor license renewal isn\u2019t as simple as just filling out the same form as last time. These types of changes often require extra paperwork, and if you skip these steps, your application could be delayed or denied.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you may need to include with your renewal if your business has changed:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A New Lease or Proof of Property Ownership<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business has moved, you\u2019ll need to provide updated documentation showing that you have legal permission to operate at your new location. This might be a signed lease or a deed if you own the property.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Updated Owner Information<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you added a new business partner or removed someone from your ownership team? The SLA needs to know. You\u2019ll need to submit updated corporate or ownership documents showing who is now responsible for the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>New Floor Plans or Interior Photos<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your new space looks different from the one previously approved, or even if you\u2019ve remodeled your current location, you may need to include updated floor plans or photos. This helps the SLA confirm that your space meets their rules and regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Details About Corporate Changes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If your business structure has changed, like switching from a sole proprietorship to an LLC, you\u2019ll need to submit proof of that as well. Even small legal changes should be documented during the liquor license renewal process.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>\u201cDo I Really Need to Update All This?\u201d<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. It\u2019s easy to assume that small changes won\u2019t matter, but the SLA requires up-to-date and accurate information for every renewal. If something has changed and you don\u2019t report it, you could be flagged for non-compliance, which might delay your approval or trigger fines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pro Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When in doubt, talk to a Asset Recovery Attorney or check directly with the SLA. It\u2019s always better to submit more information than to leave something out and risk rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is There an Online Option?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common questions we hear is: <\/span><b>\u201cCan I renew my liquor license online in New York?\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the answer, for now, is <\/span><b>not really.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>At this time, most liquor license renewal applications must be completed by hand and mailed to the New York State Liquor Authority along with the appropriate fee. That means printing the forms, filling them out, gathering your documents, and sending everything in together.<\/p>\n<p>However, the SLA is working to modernize its systems, and there are some updates available online, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viewing license status<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downloading application forms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking for requirements or updates<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking up your expiration date<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Where to check:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Visit the official New York State Liquor Authority website regularly to stay updated on any system changes. They occasionally update processes, so online submissions may become more widely available in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Forget Year-Round Compliance<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Getting your liquor license renewed is a major step, but it\u2019s only part of the bigger picture. To keep your license in good standing, you\u2019ll need to stay compliant with SLA rules all year long. That means following the law, keeping your business organized, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/liquor-license-suspension\/\">avoiding violations that could lead to penalties or suspension.<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are some key things to remember:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Display Your License Properly<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liquor license must be posted where customers and inspectors can easily see it. If it\u2019s hidden, missing, or expired, that\u2019s an easy violation to avoid.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Follow Local Laws and Approved Hours<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every license comes with specific rules, like the hours you\u2019re allowed to serve alcohol and the types of beverages you can sell. Stick to those rules to avoid trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Don\u2019t Serve Minors or Visibly Intoxicated Guests<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may seem obvious, but these are two of the most common reasons businesses get penalized. Make sure your staff is trained and ID checks are part of your routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Keep Accurate and Updated Records<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have clear, organized records of your ownership, lease, alcohol purchases, and employee training. If the SLA requests proof of anything, you\u2019ll be ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Stay Informed About SLA Updates<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rules and policies change. Sign up for SLA email alerts or work with an attorney to stay on top of important changes that could affect your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How long does a liquor license last in NY?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most retail licenses last 2 years, wholesale\/manufacturing licenses last 3 years, and temporary permits last 90 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>When should I start renewing?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Start the process at least 60\u201390 days before your license expires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Can I renew online?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not yet. Most renewals must be mailed, though the SLA is working on digital options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stay Ahead of Liquor License Renewal<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you own a business that serves or sells alcohol, you can\u2019t afford to take chances with your liquor license. Starting your liquor license renewal process early gives you time to fix any issues, avoid penalties, and keep your business running smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>And remember, how long does a liquor license last depends on the type, so always double-check your expiration date and set a reminder.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need help renewing your liquor license or handling paperwork?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/contact-us\/\"><b>Contact The Kearney Law Group<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today.
