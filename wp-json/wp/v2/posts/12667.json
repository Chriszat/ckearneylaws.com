On-Premises Liquor License<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most common liquor licenses for bars and restaurants in New York. If you plan to serve <\/span><b>alcohol to customers who will drink it at your location<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then this is probably the license you\u2019ll need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An <\/span><b>on-premises liquor license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to serve:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beer<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wine<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Spirits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like vodka, rum, whiskey, tequila, etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This license is required for places where people gather, dine, or enjoy entertainment while drinking, whether it\u2019s a sit-down dinner, a live music night, or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/social-host-liability-law\/\">a private party hosted at your venue.<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Businesses that typically need this license include:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bars and pubs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full-service restaurants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breweries with taprooms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hotels with lounges or rooftop bars<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightclubs and entertainment venues<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Helpful Tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/a><\/span> offers different versions of this license. For example, there\u2019s a restaurant-specific license for places where food sales are the primary focus, and alcohol is secondary. This can be a good option if your business isn\u2019t bar-focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I use this license for takeout alcohol?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not usually. On-premises licenses are for alcohol served and consumed at your location. For alcohol to-go, you&#8217;d need a separate license or a special pandemic-related permit (if available).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Beer and Wine Only License<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business doesn\u2019t plan to serve hard liquor, you may qualify for a <\/span><b>beer and wine only license<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This license is a great choice for businesses that want to offer a more casual experience, or simply avoid the higher costs and stricter rules of a full liquor license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>This license allows you to serve:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer (including craft and imported)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wine<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hard cider (depending on your local rules)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Who typically uses this license:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small caf\u00e9s or bistros<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast-casual restaurants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee shops offering wine tastings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bakeries with sit-down service<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juice bars or smoothie spots with beer\/cider options<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why this license is popular:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s often <\/span><b>easier and faster to get approved<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than a full liquor license, and the requirements can be a little more flexible, especially for newer or smaller businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if I want to add liquor later on?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can upgrade. Many businesses start with a beer and wine license and later apply for a full on-premises liquor license once they\u2019re more established.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Off-Premises Liquor License<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This license is for businesses that sell <\/span><b>sealed containers of alcohol<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for customers to take home. If your customers are <\/span><b>not consuming alcohol at your store<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this is the type of license you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You\u2019ll need this if you operate a:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquor store<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wine shop<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery store or convenience store selling beer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Types of off-premises licenses in New York include:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Liquor Store License<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 allows the sale of liquor and wine<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wine Store License<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 allows the sale of wine only (no liquor)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Beer Retail License<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 allows the sale of beer and sometimes cider, depending on local laws<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Important to Know:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cannot<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allow customers to open bottles or drink alcohol inside your store. If you plan to host tastings or other drinking activities on-site, you\u2019ll likely need both off-premises and on-premises permissions, or a special permit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I sell alcohol online or offer delivery?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Possibly, but you&#8217;ll need to meet additional requirements. The SLA has specific rules for online alcohol sales and delivery, so be sure to check those before offering that service.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Temporary or Event Permits<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business doesn\u2019t usually serve alcohol but wants to offer it for a <\/span><b>special event<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can apply for a <\/span><b>temporary permit<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are perfect for <\/span><b>one-time or short-term situations<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and can be more flexible than a full liquor license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Examples of when you might need a temporary alcohol permit:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A nonprofit holding a fundraising gala<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A chef hosting a pop-up dinner or tasting event<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brewery setting up a tasting booth at a community festival<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A wedding or private event hosted in a rented venue<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>What you can expect:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These permits usually cover a 24-hour period (or a weekend)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You still need to apply <\/span><b>at least several weeks in advance<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA will want to know the event details, who\u2019s organizing it, where it\u2019s being held, and how alcohol will be served or managed<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Heads-Up:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You may also need local approval, such as a letter of permission from the property owner or local law enforcement, depending on the location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I get a permit on short notice?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s not recommended.

The process involves several steps, each with its own requirements. You\u2019ll need to collect paperwork, share financial information, notify your local community, and meet certain legal standards. If you\u2019re opening a new bar, restaurant, or store that sells alcohol, knowing what to expect ahead of time can help you avoid delays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s walk through the <\/span><b>main liquor license requirements<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New York so you can be prepared from the start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Business Documents<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you can apply, you need to prove that your business is officially set up and operating legally. That means gathering a few important documents:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Certificate of Incorporation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (if you\u2019ve formed a corporation)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>LLC formation paperwork<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (if your business is an LLC)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Your business lease or property deed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 This shows that you either own the property or have permission to use it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>A detailed floor plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your location \u2013 The State Liquor Authority (SLA) needs to see exactly how your space is laid out. This includes tables, bars, bathrooms, entrances, exits, and where alcohol will be served or stored.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I need to have my location set up before applying?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes. You should already have a signed lease or deed and be ready to show the floor plan. If you apply too early, before you secure your space, your application may be rejected.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Financial Information<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA requires complete transparency when it comes to money. They want to make sure your business is being funded legally and that all partners are known and approved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to show:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Personal and business bank statements<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Details of any loans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (including the lender and repayment terms)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Investment paperwork<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if anyone has given you money to start your business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>A breakdown of ownership<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 Who owns what percentage of the business?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why it matters:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your financing isn\u2019t clear or if the SLA suspects that someone is hiding behind the scenes (known as a \u201chidden owner\u201d), they may deny your license.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Fingerprints and Background Checks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone who owns a stake in your business, whether it\u2019s 10% or 90%, will need to go through a background check. This includes submitting fingerprints through a certified fingerprinting service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA will look into:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Past criminal convictions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (especially related to alcohol, drugs, or fraud)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Any previous violations of alcohol laws<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Involvement in other businesses that lost their liquor license<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If someone on your team has a history of serious violations or criminal charges, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019ll be denied, but it could slow things down or raise red flags.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Community Board Notification (Required in NYC and Some Other Areas)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is located in <\/span><b>New York City<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019re required to notify the local <\/span><b>Community Board<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least <\/span><b>30 days before<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you apply for your liquor license.

Even small changes, like moving a bar or adding a patio, can delay the process or trigger an extra inspection.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Happens If You Miss a Requirement?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you forget something, send in the wrong paperwork, or fail to meet a requirement, your application could be delayed, or even denied. Many businesses don\u2019t realize how detailed the process is until they\u2019re several weeks in and hitting roadblocks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Alcohol Compliance: What Happens After You Get Your License<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting your liquor license is a big milestone, but it\u2019s only the beginning. Once you\u2019re approved, your next job is to <\/span><b>stay in compliance with alcohol laws<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at all times. This is called <\/span><b>alcohol compliance<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it\u2019s all about making sure your business follows the rules for serving and selling alcohol safely and legally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ignore these rules, you could face serious consequences, like hefty fines, license suspensions, or even losing your liquor license for good. But the good news is, with the right knowledge and systems in place, staying compliant can become part of your everyday routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Is Alcohol Compliance?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Alcohol compliance<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> refers to the set of rules and laws that all licensed businesses must follow after they receive their liquor license. These laws are enforced by the <\/span><b>New York State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are designed to protect public safety, promote responsible alcohol service, and ensure fair business practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These rules cover everything from checking IDs to knowing what hours you\u2019re allowed to sell alcohol. Failing to follow them, even accidentally, can result in violations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Key Alcohol Compliance Rules You Must Follow<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your license is active, here are some of the main things your business needs to do to stay compliant:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Never Serve Alcohol to Minors<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the biggest and most serious rules. <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/dram-shop-law\/#:~:text=What%20Counts%20as,and%20stopped%20serving.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You are not allowed to sell or serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 21, <\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">even if they have a fake ID or \u201clook old enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if I didn\u2019t know they were underage?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Unfortunately, not knowing isn\u2019t a valid excuse. If you\u2019re caught serving alcohol to a minor, your business could face fines, license suspension, or even criminal charges. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to train your staff to check ID every time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Don\u2019t Serve Clearly Intoxicated People<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s illegal to serve alcohol to someone who\u2019s already visibly drunk. This rule helps prevent accidents, fights, and other safety issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What counts as \u201cvisibly intoxicated\u201d?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Slurred speech, stumbling, aggressive behavior, or nodding off at the table are all warning signs. If your staff notices any of these, they should politely refuse to serve more drinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Keep Your Business Hours Within Legal Limits<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liquor license only allows you to sell alcohol during certain hours. These hours vary depending on your license type and location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>For example:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most of New York City, bars must stop serving alcohol by 4 a.m.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some counties, the cut-off time might be earlier, like 2 a.m. or midnight.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>What happens if I keep serving after hours?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s considered a violation. You could be fined or even lose your license. Make sure your team knows exactly when to stop serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Post Your Liquor License Where Customers Can See It<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SLA requires you to <\/span><b>display your liquor license certificate in a visible spot<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, usually near your entrance or behind the bar. This proves your business is operating legally and lets inspectors confirm you\u2019re properly licensed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you move to a new location or remodel your space, make sure your license is still displayed and easy to find.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why Staff Training Is a Must<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with all the rules posted, your business is only as compliant as your staff. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a smart idea to invest in formal training for anyone who sells or serves alcohol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the most widely accepted training programs are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS)<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.servsafe.com\/access\/ss\/catalog\/productdetail\/ssaolp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>ServSafe Alcohol<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These programs teach your staff how to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spot fake IDs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handle tricky customer situations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know when to stop serving<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protect your business from violations<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Some insurance companies even offer discounts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to businesses that train their staff, because it reduces the risk of alcohol-related incidents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Happens If You Break the Rules?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is caught violating alcohol compliance laws, the consequences can be serious, especially for repeat offenders. Here&#8217;s what could happen:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>First offense:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You might get a warning or a fine<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Second offense:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You could face license suspension or stricter operating rules<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Major or repeated violations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The SLA could revoke your liquor license completely<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And remember, once a violation is on your record, it could also make it harder to renew your license later or expand your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Staying Compliant Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Hard<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying compliant is really about being consistent. When you build alcohol compliance into your business\u2019s daily routine, it becomes second nature. Here are a few ways to make it easier:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review SLA rules with your team during staff meetings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep ID scanners or age-verification tools at all service areas<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do regular walkthroughs to make sure your license is posted and policies are followed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call a liquor licensing attorney if you\u2019re unsure about a specific rule or situation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><b>The Kearney Law Group<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we help business owners not only get their licenses, but keep them. We\u2019re here to help you stay on track with New York\u2019s alcohol compliance rules so your business can grow safely and legally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Common Mistakes That Can Slow You Down<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for a liquor license in New York isn\u2019t something you can do overnight. It\u2019s a detailed process, and on average, it takes about <\/span><b>4 to 6 months<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sometimes even longer, especially if your paperwork isn\u2019t in order or if the State Liquor Authority (SLA) requests more information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, many business owners unintentionally slow things down by making mistakes during the application process. Even small issues can lead to big delays. If you&#8217;re planning to open a bar, restaurant, liquor store, or any other business that serves or sells alcohol, it&#8217;s important to avoid the most common pitfalls from the start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mistake #1: Missing Paperwork<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the biggest reasons applications get delayed or rejected. The SLA requires a lot of documentation, and every single item matters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you forget to include even one required form or supporting document, your application might be returned or placed on hold until everything is corrected. This can add weeks, or even months, to your timeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What to double-check:<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have your lease or deed?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you include all business formation documents (like your Certificate of Incorporation or LLC paperwork)?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your floor plan included?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you fill out every section of the application?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if I realize I forgot something after I apply?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can submit the missing documents later, but it will delay your review. In many cases, the SLA won\u2019t start processing your application until everything is complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mistake #2: Incomplete or Incorrect Floor Plans<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your floor plan isn\u2019t just a sketch, it\u2019s a legal document that shows how your business is laid out. The SLA uses it to understand how alcohol will be served and stored, where customers will sit, and how your space is structured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your floor plan is missing details, has errors, or doesn\u2019t match the actual setup of your space, the SLA will send it back. That means more delays and possibly even a required inspection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips to avoid this mistake:<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include all entrances and exits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show where alcohol will be stored and served<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Label tables, counters, and bar areas clearly<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure the layout matches your Certificate of Occupancy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I hand-draw the floor plan?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It depends. While hand-drawn plans are sometimes accepted, they need to be <\/span><b>clear, accurate, and to scale<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For best results, it\u2019s a good idea to use a professional draftsperson or architect.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mistake #3: Not Notifying the Community Board in Time (Especially in NYC)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York City and some surrounding areas, businesses are <\/span><b>required to notify the local community board at least 30 days before<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> applying for a liquor license. This gives the community a chance to review your plans and provide feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you skip this step, or send the notice too late, your application can be rejected or delayed until the proper notification is made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To stay on schedule:<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submit the 30-Day Advance Notice Form on time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep proof that it was delivered<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attend any scheduled board meetings if asked<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will the community board\u2019s opinion affect my approval?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not always, but the SLA takes public feedback seriously. If the board strongly objects to your business, it could impact your chances of getting licensed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mistake #4: Applying for the Wrong Type of License<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all liquor licenses are the same, and applying for the wrong one is a common, and costly, mistake. For example, applying for a full liquor license when you only plan to serve beer and wine can lead to unnecessary fees and delays. On the flip side, applying for a limited license when you plan to serve cocktails could get your application denied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you apply, ask yourself:<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are customers drinking on the premises or taking bottles to-go?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will I serve hard liquor, or just beer and wine?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this a permanent business or a temporary event?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I change the license type after applying?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It depends. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to withdraw your current application and start over, which resets the review timeline. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get it right the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why It Pays to Work with a Liquor Licensing Attorney<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, a lot can go wrong in the application process, and each mistake costs you time, money, and momentum.
