It doesn\u2019t matter if the incident happens inside your business or hours later. If you served the alcohol, your business could be on the hook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a closer look at what dram shop law is, what it means for your business, and how you can avoid a costly lawsuit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Is Dram Shop Law?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Dram shop law<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> refers to the legal rules that hold alcohol-serving businesses, like bars, restaurants, and event venues, responsible if they serve someone who later causes harm while intoxicated. In New York, this law is more than just a warning; it\u2019s written into the state\u2019s civil code and can lead to serious financial consequences if not followed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term \u201cdram shop\u201d comes from 18th-century England, where taverns sold gin by the dram, a small unit of measure. Today, the phrase lives on in laws that deal with how alcohol is sold and the liability that comes with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The Basics of New York&#8217;s Dram Shop Law<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York, dram shop liability is covered under <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nysenate.gov\/legislation\/laws\/GOB\/11-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>General Obligations Law \u00a711-101<\/b><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It states that a business can be sued by a third party if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol was <\/span><b>unlawfully provided<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (to someone under 21 or visibly intoxicated)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That person caused <\/span><b>injury, death, or property damage<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The alcohol served was a <\/span><b>contributing factor<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the incident<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that your business could be pulled into a lawsuit, even if the incident happened after the customer left your premises.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Counts as \u201cUnlawful\u201d Alcohol Service?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two main situations where alcohol service becomes illegal in New York:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Serving Minors<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/new-york-liquor-laws\/#:~:text=ABC%20Law%20%C2%A7%2065(1)%20%E2%80%93%20%C2%A0In%20New%20York%2C%20it%20is%20illegal%20to%20sell%20or%20give%20alcoholic%20beverages%20to%20anyone%20under%20the%20age%20of%2021.%20This%20applies%20regardless%20of%20whether%20the%20person%20presents%20a%20fake%20ID%20or%20is%20accompanied%20by%20a%20parent%20or%20legal%20guardian.\">It is always unlawful to serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 21, even if they have fake identification.<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Serving Visibly Intoxicated Individuals<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 If someone is showing clear signs of intoxication, such as slurred speech, glassy eyes, or trouble standing, and your staff continues to serve them, that may be considered negligent under dram shop law.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The standard isn\u2019t whether someone was legally drunk but whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d would have recognized the signs and stopped serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Real-World Example<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a man visits your bar and drinks several cocktails quickly. His speech becomes slurred, he stumbles on the way to the restroom, and other patrons take notice. If your bartender continues to serve him despite these visible signs of intoxication, and the man later causes a car accident, your business could face a dram shop lawsuit from the injured party. Even though you didn\u2019t cause the crash, the law sees your business\u2019s actions as a contributing factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Who Can File a Dram Shop Claim?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important thing to understand is that dram shop claims are often brought by <\/span><b>third parties<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not the person who was served. This might include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A driver injured in a crash caused by an intoxicated customer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pedestrian or cyclist hit by a drunk driver<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A family member filing a wrongful death claim<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A victim of an alcohol-fueled assault or altercation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these cases, the lawsuit isn\u2019t just about what happened inside your business, it\u2019s about the chain of events that followed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Dram Shop Law vs. Criminal Charges<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dram shop law is a <\/span><b>civil statute<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not a criminal one. That means you\u2019re not at risk of jail time, but you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at risk of being sued and held financially liable. And while this law doesn\u2019t result in criminal punishment, a violation could still lead to problems with the <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>New York State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which may suspend or revoke your liquor license if they find you\u2019ve acted irresponsibly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Is Dram Shop Law the Same for Private Hosts?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, New York\u2019s dram shop law applies only to businesses that are licensed to serve alcohol. However, <\/span><b>social hosts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can still be liable if they serve alcohol to <\/span><b>minors<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So if someone under 21 drinks at a house party and causes an accident, the host could be legally responsible, even if they didn\u2019t buy the alcohol themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12526 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"812\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1-1120x560.jpg 1120w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Why Should Business Owners Care About Dram Shop Law?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own a bar, restaurant, or any business that serves alcohol, <\/span>dram shop law isn\u2019t just legal fine print, it\u2019s a serious risk that could cost you your business<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many owners assume that once a customer walks out the door, what happens next isn\u2019t their responsibility. But <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/blog\/new-york-liquor-laws\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">under New York law<\/a><\/span><\/strong>, that\u2019s not always true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t serve alcohol often or you trust your staff to make good decisions, one mistake can lead to a lawsuit, a damaged reputation, or even the loss of your liquor license. Here\u2019s why this law matters and what you need to know to protect what you\u2019ve built.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>You Could Face a Major Lawsuit<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest risks under dram shop law is the possibility of being sued if someone you served causes harm. These lawsuits don\u2019t come from the person who drank too much, they often come from the people they hurt.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say a customer leaves your bar drunk, drives away, and causes a crash. The victim of that crash could file a lawsuit against your business, claiming that your staff served someone who was clearly intoxicated. That lawsuit could seek damages for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency room visits and hospital bills<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lost wages if the person can\u2019t work<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ongoing therapy or rehabilitation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional distress and suffering<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, these claims can reach <\/span><b>hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even if the case doesn\u2019t go to trial, settling out of court can still be expensive and time-consuming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Can my business be sued even if I didn\u2019t serve the drinks myself?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes. As the owner, your business is responsible for what your staff does while working. That\u2019s why staff training and clear alcohol service policies are so important.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Your Insurance Might Not Protect You<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to assume your business insurance covers everything, but that\u2019s not always the case when it comes to alcohol. <\/span>Many general liability policies exclude liquor-related incidents<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially if your business doesn\u2019t have a separate <\/span>liquor liability policy<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that if you\u2019re sued under dram shop law and don\u2019t have the right coverage, your insurance company might deny your claim, and you\u2019d be stuck paying legal fees and damages on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>How do I know if I have liquor liability coverage?<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Check your insurance policy or talk to your agent. If your business serves alcohol in any form, you should have liquor liability insurance in place, especially if you want full protection from dram shop claims.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Your Liquor License Could Be Suspended or Revoked<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York\u2019s <\/span><b>State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> oversees the rules around who can serve alcohol and how it must be done. If your business breaks the law, by serving a minor or a visibly intoxicated person, the SLA could open an investigation. This can lead to serious penalties, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">A temporary suspension of your license<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Fines that increase with each violation<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">In some cases, permanent revocation of your license<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your license is suspended or revoked, it\u2019s not easy to get it back. Even a single violation can affect your ability to operate or expand in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Will I lose my license immediately if a claim is made?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not automatically, but if the SLA finds out about the incident and determines you violated liquor laws, they can take action. This is often in addition to any civil lawsuit you\u2019re facing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Your Reputation Could Take a Hit<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the age of online reviews and social media, word spreads fast, especially when something goes wrong. If your business is named in a lawsuit or accused of overserving a customer who later caused harm, your reputation could suffer even if you win the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may lose loyal customers who no longer feel safe at your business. Local news coverage could make it harder to attract new patrons or staff. And vendors or landlords might hesitate to work with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebuilding trust takes time, and it\u2019s always harder to recover after a negative story than it is to prevent one in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if the person who caused the harm didn\u2019t look drunk?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s exactly the kind of question that leads to lawsuits. Dram shop cases often depend on witness accounts, video footage, and how well your staff followed your alcohol policies. If the case makes it to court, the judgment could come down to whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d would have stopped serving that customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Bottom Line: It\u2019s About Protecting What You\u2019ve Built<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve put time, money, and energy into your business. Dram shop law puts that investment at risk if you don\u2019t take alcohol service seriously. From the front of the house to the back, everyone on your team needs to understand their role in keeping customers safe, and your business out of legal trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Dram Shop Liability: What Can Go Wrong?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Running a busy bar or restaurant means juggling a lot at once, keeping customers happy, managing staff, and staying on top of regulations. But even one slip-up in how alcohol is served can lead to serious legal trouble under New York\u2019s dram shop law. If you or your staff serve someone who shouldn\u2019t be drinking, and that person later causes injury or damage, your business could be held responsible, even if the incident happens miles away from your location.<\/p>\n<p>So what does that look like in the real world? Here are some of the most common situations where dram shop liability can come into play, and why it\u2019s so important to have strong policies and trained staff in place.<\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Serving Someone Who\u2019s Clearly Intoxicated<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most common and most dangerous scenarios. If a customer is visibly drunk, they\u2019re slurring their speech, stumbling, acting aggressive, or showing poor coordination, your staff is legally required to stop serving them alcohol. Continuing to serve a visibly intoxicated person is considered negligent under New York law.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say someone is swaying at the bar, raising their voice, and struggling to sign their check. If your bartender serves them another drink and they later get behind the wheel and crash into another driver, your business could be named in a dram shop lawsuit. Courts often look at what a \u201creasonable person\u201d would have done in that situation. If the signs were obvious and your team ignored them, you could be seen as partly responsible for the harm that followed.<\/p>\n<p><b>What if the person didn\u2019t \u201cseem that drunk\u201d to the staff?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What seems \u201cnormal\u201d in a loud or lively environment may not hold up in court. If there\u2019s video evidence, eyewitnesses, or other proof that the customer was clearly intoxicated, your team\u2019s judgment may be called into question. That\u2019s why consistent training and documentation are so important.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Serving Alcohol to a Minor<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Even if a customer presents what looks like a valid ID, your business is still required to make a reasonable effort to verify age. Serving alcohol to anyone under 21 is illegal in New York, and if that minor later causes harm, your business could be held accountable under both dram shop law and state liquor laws.<\/p>\n<p>This kind of liability can get especially tricky. For example, if a teenager uses a fake ID and your staff doesn\u2019t spot it, or fails to ask for ID at all, and that teen later injures someone in a drunk driving crash, your business may be on the hook. Saying \u201cthey looked older\u201d or \u201cthey had an ID\u201d isn\u2019t always a strong enough defense if the ID wasn\u2019t checked properly.<\/p>\n<p><b>Are we protected if the customer used a fake ID?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not necessarily. If your staff didn\u2019t follow standard ID-checking procedures or missed obvious signs that the ID was fake (like mismatched birthdates or a low-quality print), a court may still hold your business responsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Lack of Staff Training and Oversight<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your intentions are good, poor staff training can open the door to dram shop liability. If your employees don\u2019t know how to recognize signs of intoxication, or don\u2019t understand the legal importance of refusing service, mistakes are more likely to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the problem isn\u2019t just one bad judgment call. It could be that your team never received proper alcohol service training, or that your business doesn\u2019t have clear policies in place. That lack of preparation can be used against you in court to show <\/span><b>negligence<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a <\/span><b>failure to exercise reasonable care<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s an example: a new server doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re supposed to ID everyone under 30, so they serve a 19-year-old who looks older. That teen leaves, causes a crash, and the victim sues. In the investigation, it\u2019s revealed that your business had no training materials, no policy manual, and no record of employee guidance. That lack of structure becomes part of the legal case, and it can make it harder to defend your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What kind of training is required?<\/b> New York doesn\u2019t require a specific alcohol training program by law, but courts do look favorably on businesses that implement recognized programs like TIPS (Training for Intervention Procedures). These programs teach staff how to spot signs of intoxication, check IDs properly, and handle difficult situations calmly.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Putting It All Together: One Mistake Can Snowball<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk with dram shop liability isn\u2019t just about the initial mistake, it\u2019s about the chain reaction that can follow. A bad call at the bar can lead to a crash, a lawsuit, an insurance denial, a suspended liquor license, and a damaged reputation. And once your business is under legal and public scrutiny, recovery can take years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to protect your business is to treat every alcohol service decision as if it could be reviewed later in a courtroom. That means training your team, setting clear rules, documenting incidents, and always putting safety first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12527 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"688\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2-1120x560.jpg 1120w, https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/dram-shop-law-in-New-York-2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to Protect Your Business from Dram Shop Liability<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serving alcohol may be part of your everyday business, but with it comes serious responsibility. The good news is that <\/span><b>you can take real, practical steps to reduce your risk<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and protect your bar, restaurant, or venue from dram shop liability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawsuits under New York\u2019s dram shop law are often based on whether the business acted <\/span><b>reasonably and responsibly<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So your best defense is to show that you did everything possible to serve alcohol safely, train your staff properly, and follow the law at every step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to do just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Train Your Staff the Right Way<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your team is your first line of defense. Whether it\u2019s a bartender, server, or floor manager, anyone who serves alcohol should know how to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Spot the signs of visible intoxication<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Check IDs properly and confidently<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Refuse service when needed, without escalating the situation<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider investing in a nationally recognized program like <\/span><b>TIPS (Training for Intervention Procedures)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><b>ServSafe Alcohol<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs teach practical skills, including how to de-escalate situations and make judgment calls under pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Do I have to train every single employee?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Legally, it\u2019s not required in New York, but from a liability perspective, it\u2019s a smart move. If a lawsuit ever arises, documented staff training shows that your business took proactive steps to prevent the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Create and Enforce Written Alcohol Policies<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verbal instructions aren\u2019t enough. Every business that serves alcohol should have <\/span><b>clear, written rules<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for how alcohol is served, and those rules should be reviewed regularly with your staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your alcohol service policy should cover:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>How to check IDs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and what types of ID are acceptable<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>When and how to refuse service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a visibly intoxicated guest<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>What to do in case of an incident<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including who to notify and how to document it<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post these policies in areas your staff can easily reference, like the employee break room, behind the bar, or in a staff handbook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How often should we review these policies with our team?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s best to do a refresher every few months and after any major incident. Keeping the information fresh helps your staff stay confident and consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Document Incidents Immediately<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something happens, such as a guest being cut off, using a fake ID, or causing a disruption, <\/span><b>write it down right away<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Details fade quickly, and your staff may not remember everything if they\u2019re asked to testify weeks or months later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a simple incident log where managers can note:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer\u2019s name or description<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What signs of intoxication were observed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What steps were taken (refused service, called a cab, etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time, date, and who was involved<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of documentation can be incredibly helpful if your business is ever named in a dram shop lawsuit. It shows you were alert, responsible, and following the law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where should we store these records?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Keep a secure digital or paper log for at least one year. Some businesses also include incident reports in their shift notes or POS system for backup.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Make Sure You Have the Right Insurance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many business owners are surprised to learn that their general liability insurance <\/span><b>doesn\u2019t automatically cover liquor-related incidents<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To be fully protected, you need to carry <\/span><b>liquor liability insurance<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, either as a standalone policy or added onto your existing coverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of insurance can help cover:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal defense costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Settlements or court-ordered damages<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical expenses for injured third parties<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Is liquor liability insurance required in New York?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s not required by law, but it\u2019s strongly recommended, especially if you serve alcohol regularly. Without it, one lawsuit could bankrupt your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Stay Compliant with State Laws and SLA Regulations<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>New York State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sets strict rules about who can serve alcohol, how it\u2019s served, and what happens if you break the law. Even a single violation, like serving a minor or failing to check ID, can result in fines or a suspended liquor license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To stay compliant:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your liquor license current and clearly posted<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand your license class (on-premise, catering, etc.) and its restrictions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t serve alcohol past your approved hours<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Report any major incidents to the SLA as required<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing regular internal audits, like checking how IDs are verified or how well staff follow your alcohol policy, can help catch problems before they escalate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What happens if the SLA finds a violation?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They can issue warnings, fines, or suspend your license depending on the seriousness of the issue. Repeat violations or serving a minor can even lead to permanent revocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What If You Get Sued?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with the best planning, things can go wrong. If your business is sued under New York\u2019s <\/span><b>dram shop law<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s important to stay calm, and act quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what typically happens:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person filing the lawsuit (usually a third party) must prove that your business <\/span><b>unlawfully served alcohol<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, either to someone under 21 or someone visibly intoxicated, and that the service <\/span><b>directly led to the harm.<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll be contacted by a lawyer or served legal papers. You may also receive notice from the SLA if the case involves a liquor law violation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the claim, you could face <\/span><b>legal costs, court appearances, and potential damages<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even if you believe your staff acted properly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why having a trusted legal partner is so important. A lawyer experienced in dram shop liability and liquor law can help you:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Build a strong defense<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Communicate with the SLA<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Navigate insurance claims<\/b><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Protect your business reputation<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Can we fight the lawsuit if we did everything right?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yes. If you documented the incident, followed your policies, and your staff acted appropriately, your legal team may be able to dismiss the claim or reduce your liability. Courts often look at how well the business managed the situation, not just the outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How The Kearney Law Group Can Help<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Kearney Law Group<\/strong><\/span><\/a>, we work with bar and restaurant owners across New York to help them follow liquor laws, avoid violations, and defend against lawsuits. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaws.com\/our-team\/cannon-kearney\/\">Our lead attorney, Cannon C.
