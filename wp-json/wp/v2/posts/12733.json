Before you can pour a single drink, you need to know <strong>how to get a liquor license<\/strong>. It&#8217;s one of the most important (and sometimes confusing) parts of starting a business <a href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/practice-area\/liquor-law\/\">that sells alcohol<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This guide will walk you through the process step by step, from choosing the right license to understanding <strong>how much it costs to get a liquor license<\/strong>. We&#8217;ll also cover some common mistakes and how to avoid them. If you&#8217;re planning to serve alcohol in New York, understanding liquor law is crucial for your business success.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\"><strong>Why You Need a Liquor License<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you&#8217;re planning to sell alcohol in New York, whether by the glass at a restaurant or by the bottle at a liquor store, you&#8217;ll need a liquor license. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your business is big or small, or if you&#8217;re serving beer, wine, or hard liquor. In New York, the law requires you to get approval from the <a href=\"https:\/\/sla.ny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State Liquor Authority (SLA)<\/a> before you can legally sell any kind of alcohol.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>So, why is a liquor license so important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Selling alcohol without a license isn&#8217;t just a small mistake; it&#8217;s a serious violation. If you try to open your doors without one, you could face fines, delays, or even get your business shut down before you make your first sale. That&#8217;s why knowing <strong>how to get a liquor license<\/strong> and doing it the right way matters so much.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>What does a liquor license do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A liquor license gives you legal permission to sell alcohol under specific rules. The SLA decides what type of license you need based on your business. For example, a restaurant that wants to serve wine with dinner will apply for a different license than a grocery store that sells beer to go. If you get the wrong license or forget to follow the rules, you could lose your ability to sell altogether.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Is getting a liquor license difficult?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">It can be. The process involves a lot of paperwork, legal requirements, and waiting. You&#8217;ll need to provide documents about your business, your location, your finances, and more. And if you&#8217;re in New York City, you also have to notify your local Community Board before applying, which adds another layer to the process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Because there are so many details involved, many business owners choose to work with a lawyer who understands <a class=\"underline\" href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/blog\/liquor-license-requirements\/\">liquor license requirements<\/a>. An experienced attorney can help you figure out which license fits your business, prepare your application, and avoid common mistakes that could delay your approval.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you&#8217;re serious about opening a business that sells alcohol, getting a liquor license is one of the most important first steps. It protects your business, keeps you in good standing with the law, and gives your customers confidence that you&#8217;re operating legally and responsibly.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\"><strong>How to Get a Liquor License in New York: Step-by-Step<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you&#8217;re trying to figure out <strong>how to get a liquor license<\/strong>, you&#8217;re not alone. The process can feel overwhelming at first, but once you break it down step by step, it becomes much easier to understand. Here&#8217;s a closer look at what you&#8217;ll need to do in New York to get approved and start selling alcohol legally.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>1. Pick the Right Type of License<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Not all liquor licenses are the same, so the first step is choosing the one that matches your business. Ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Will people be drinking alcohol on-site?<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Will I only be selling sealed bottles or cans to go?<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Am I hosting a one-time event or opening a full-time business?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Here are the most common license types in New York:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>On-premises license<\/strong> \u2013 This is for restaurants, bars, clubs, or lounges where customers will drink on location.<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Off-premises license<\/strong> \u2013 This is for liquor stores, grocery stores, or convenience shops that sell alcohol to take home.<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Special event or temporary permits<\/strong> \u2013 These are for one-day or seasonal events, catering companies, breweries, or wineries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Helpful tip:<\/strong> If you&#8217;re unsure which license applies to your situation, a liquor license attorney can help you avoid choosing the wrong one. Getting it wrong could mean delays or having to start the application over.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>2. Make Sure You&#8217;re Eligible<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Before you start gathering paperwork, you need to make sure you qualify to apply. The State Liquor Authority (SLA) has a few basic rules:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You must be <strong>at least 21 years old<\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You need to be a <strong>U.S. citizen or legal resident<\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You can&#8217;t have a <strong>felony conviction<\/strong> (some exceptions may apply)<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You must <strong>own or lease the property<\/strong> where the alcohol will be sold<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Your location must meet <strong>zoning requirements and SLA regulations<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Understanding these <a class=\"underline\" href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/blog\/new-york-liquor-laws\/\">New York liquor laws<\/a> is essential before starting your application. The regulations can be complex, and each municipality may have additional requirements beyond state law.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Special NYC Rule:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If your business is in <strong>New York City<\/strong>, you&#8217;ll also need to <strong>notify your local Community Board<\/strong> at least <strong>30 days before<\/strong> submitting your application. This gives the community a chance to provide feedback or raise concerns.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>3. Get Your Paperwork Ready<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This step takes the most time, but it&#8217;s also where people make the most mistakes. Missing documents or forgetting small details can cause long delays or even lead to a denied application.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll usually need to include:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A <strong>floor plan<\/strong> of the premises showing where alcohol will be stored and served<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A copy of your <strong>lease agreement or proof of ownership<\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Personal background info for all business owners and partners<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A sample <strong>menu<\/strong> (for bars or restaurants)<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A <strong>business plan<\/strong> showing how your business will operate<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Photos<\/strong> of both the inside and outside of your location<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Financial documents<\/strong> like bank statements and funding sources<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Helpful tip:<\/strong> This is a great time to talk to a lawyer. They can help organize your documents, double-check everything, and make sure nothing important is missing.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>4. Submit Your Application to the SLA<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Once your paperwork is ready, you can submit your application to the <strong>New York State Liquor Authority<\/strong> (SLA). According to the <a class=\"underline\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/launch-your-business\/apply-licenses-permits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Small Business Administration<\/a>, proper licensing is a critical component of business compliance that should not be overlooked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You&#8217;ll also need to <strong>pay a filing fee<\/strong>, which varies depending on the type of license and your location. We&#8217;ll go over costs in more detail later in this guide.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>5. Post a Public Notice and Wait for Review<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">After submitting your application, the SLA will ask you to <strong>post a public notice<\/strong> at your business location. This sign lets the community know that you&#8217;ve applied for a liquor license and gives people the opportunity to ask questions or raise objections.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">During this time, the SLA will:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Review your paperwork<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Conduct background checks<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Possibly visit your business for an on-site inspection<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Contact your Community Board (if you&#8217;re in NYC)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>How long does it take?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">On average, it takes <strong>10 to 16 weeks<\/strong> for the SLA to process a liquor license application. But if something&#8217;s missing or if there are concerns from the community, it could take longer.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>6. Attend a Hearing (If Needed)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">In some cases, especially in areas where there are already many businesses serving alcohol or where community members have concerns, the SLA may ask you to attend a <strong>public hearing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">At the hearing, you&#8217;ll have a chance to explain your business, respond to questions, and address any objections.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Helpful tip:<\/strong> If you&#8217;re invited to a hearing, it&#8217;s a smart idea to bring a lawyer with you. They can speak on your behalf and help make your case stronger.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\"><strong>7. Get Your Liquor License and Start Serving<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Once your application is approved, congratulations! You&#8217;ll receive your liquor license and can legally start serving or selling alcohol.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But it doesn&#8217;t end there. You&#8217;ll still need to:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Follow the rules<\/strong> set by the SLA<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Be ready for <strong>inspections<\/strong> at any time<\/li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Renew your license<\/strong> before it expires (usually every 1 to 3 years, depending on the license type)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Breaking the rules can lead to fines, suspension, or losing your license, so staying compliant is key. It&#8217;s also important to understand potential liability issues, which is where <a class=\"underline\" href=\"https:\/\/ckearneylaw.com\/blog\/dram-shop-law\/\">dram shop law<\/a> becomes relevant to your business operations.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\"><strong>How Much Does It Cost to Get a Liquor License?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">A big question many business owners have is: <strong>How much does it cost to get a liquor license?<\/strong> And it&#8217;s a smart question to ask, because the cost isn&#8217;t the same for everyone. It depends on the <strong>type of license<\/strong> you need and <strong>where your business is located<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">In New York, liquor license fees are set by the State Liquor Authority (SLA), and they&#8217;re based on the kind of alcohol you plan to sell, how it will be sold, and the size or setup of your business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Here&#8217;s a general breakdown of the most common license types and what they typically cost:<\/p>\n<table class=\"bg-bg-100 min-w-full border-separate border-spacing-0 text-sm leading-[1.88888] whitespace-normal\" style=\"height: 185px;\" width=\"831\">\n<thead class=\"border-b-border-100\/50 border-b-[0.5px] text-left\">\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<th class=\"text-text-000 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] font-400 px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">License Type<\/th>\n<th class=\"text-text-000 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] font-400 px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Estimated Cost<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Restaurant Wine License<\/td>\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Around <strong>$960<\/strong> (for 2 years)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Beer &amp; Wine On-Premises License<\/td>\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\"><strong>$960 \u2013 $1,152<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Full Liquor License (Bar\/Restaurant)<\/td>\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\"><strong>$4,352 \u2013 $5,850<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Liquor Store License<\/td>\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\"><strong>$1,460 \u2013 $5,850<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"[tbody&gt;&amp;]:odd:bg-bg-500\/10\">\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\">Special Event or Temporary Permit<\/td>\n<td class=\"border-t-border-100\/50 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-x-[hsla(var(--border-100) \/ 0.5)] border-t-[0.5px] px-2 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:border-l-[0.5px]\"><strong>$64 \u2013 $576<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">These are just the <strong>base fees<\/strong> paid directly to the SLA.
