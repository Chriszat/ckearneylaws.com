										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong data-start="377" data-end="415">Child Support Mistakes in NY Court</strong> happen more often than parents realize. Whether you’re paying or receiving support, errors can affect your finances, legal rights, and your child’s future. Even small mistakes under New York law can create big problems. Learn more about <a class="decorated-link" href="https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/cse/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="1306" data-end="1382">New York State Child Support Guidelines</a> to ensure compliance. For official procedures, visit the <a class="decorated-link cursor-pointer" href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/Family/childsupport.shtml" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="1483" data-end="1575">NY Courts Child Support page</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missed payments, ignoring court orders, or handling support informally can lead to arrears, wage garnishments, suspended licenses, and even jail time. Many parents don’t mean to break the rules — most mistakes happen because they didn’t realize how strict New York family law can be. This guide breaks down the most common child support mistakes, why they matter, and how to avoid them.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Child Support Compliance Is More Than Just Payments</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following New York’s child support orders isn’t simply about avoiding penalties. It’s about protecting your credibility with the court and showing you take your responsibilities seriously. Judges pay close attention to which parent demonstrates responsibility — and that can influence custody and visitation decisions too.</span></p>
<h2><b>Common Child Support Mistakes in New York</b></h2>
<h3><b>Paying Support &#8216;Under the Table&#8217;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving cash directly to the other parent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: If payments aren’t documented, the court won’t count them — leaving you owing money you’ve already paid.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: Always pay through the New York State Child Support Collection Unit or another court-approved method.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ignoring Court Orders</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing or stopping payments because of job loss or disagreements.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Arrears (back payments) never disappear, and courts see skipped payments as willful defiance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: If your situation changes, file a petition to modify support immediately.</span></p>
<h3><b>Failing to Report Income Accurately</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not disclosing side jobs, tips, or cash income.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Courts can “impute” income if they believe you’re hiding money — often at a higher amount than you actually earn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: Be transparent about all income sources.</span></p>
<h3><b>Missing Court Dates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skipping support hearings out of frustration or fear.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Judges can issue default orders, often setting higher payments than if you had attended.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: Always appear in court, or have your attorney represent you.</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Child Support as Leverage</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withholding payment because visitation was denied, or vice versa.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Support and visitation are separate legal issues. Mixing them only makes matters worse.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: Handle custody and visitation disputes separately through the court.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ignoring Arrears</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believing back payments will “go away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Arrears collect interest, and enforcement may include wage garnishment, property liens, license suspension, and jail.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: Contact the support office immediately to arrange a payment plan.</span></p>
<h3><b>Overlooking Modifications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not updating your support order when income or circumstances change.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why it matters: Until you file, the court will hold you to the old order, even if your situation makes it impossible to pay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention tip: File for a modification as soon as your income or your child’s needs change.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to Protect Yourself in a Child Support Case</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Keep detailed payment records.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Always pay officially through court-approved channels.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Communicate changes quickly — don’t wait until arrears pile up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Stay professional and respectful in front of the judge.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Working with a Child Support Attorney Helps</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A family law attorney can make the process smoother and protect your rights. At </span><b>The Kearney Law Group</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we help parents:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; File or defend child support modifications.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Negotiate fair support based on accurate income.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Avoid unfair enforcement actions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Ensure every payment is properly credited.</span></p>
<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
<p><b> Can child support be changed if I lose my job?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You must file a petition for modification. Don’t stop paying until the court approves the change.</span></p>
<p><b> What happens if I don’t pay child support in New York?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may face wage garnishment, loss of your driver’s license, property liens, or jail time.</span></p>
<p><b> Can I pay child support directly to the other parent?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not unless the court allows it. Always use official payment methods so you have proof.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child support is about more than money — it’s about your child’s well-being and your future. Small mistakes like skipping payments, hiding income, or paying informally can create long-term legal and financial problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart move? Follow the rules, keep good records, and act quickly when your situation changes. With the right guidance, you can protect your rights, your finances, and your child’s best interests.</span></p>
